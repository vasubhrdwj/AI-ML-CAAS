    "Shallow Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "A shallow copy creates a new object, but it references the original nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a nested object in the original or the shallow copy will affect both objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow copy is performed using the copy() method or the slicing syntax [:].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a more efficient way of copying when the objects involved are immutable or when you don't want to create copies of nested mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep copy creates a new object and also creates new copies of all nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a nested object in the original or the deep copy will not affect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep copy is performed using the deepcopy() function from the copy module.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typically used when you want to create an independent copy of an object, including all nested mutable objects."
